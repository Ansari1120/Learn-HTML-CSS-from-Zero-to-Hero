<h1>vision mission</h1>
<p>The mission of PIAIC is to reshape Pakistan
     by revolutionizing education, research, and business by adopting latest,
      cutting-edge technologies. Experts are calling this the 4th industrial revolution.
       We want Pakistan to become a global hub for AI, data science, cloud native computing,
     edge computing, blockchain, augmented reality, and internet of things.
     In this module, students will learn about crypto tokens, how intrinsic tokens come into existence, how bitcoins, ripples, ethereal, and NXT come into existence. Students will also learn the difference between utility and security tokens. This module will also cover the legal implications of token classification. Students will also learn the eight categories of tokens. In this module, students will learn how to create their own utility tokens.


     Blockchain Revolution
     In this module, students will learn how permissionless systems work. Students will also learn about enterprise blockchain and the future of finance. This module will cover how blockchain can disrupt industries including finance, banking, insurance, and even music.

     <h2 id = "bcc" >Blockchain</h2>
     <p>In this module, students will get an introduction to digital money, 
        bitcoin and the blockchain. Students will learn about trestles systems and proof of work.
         Students will also learn the difference between private, consortium, and public blockchain networks. 
         This module will also provide an introduction to hashing and cryptography.</p>

            You won't find a top programmer, web developer, or AI engineer who doesn't use version control.
             This is true because version control helps developers produce better results and makes collaboration easy.
              Around the world, in teams both large and small, 
            Git is an essential part of the toolchain. This module covers Git and Github.
            n the second module of the program, students will learn about basic programming concepts such as lists, 
            dictionaries, classes, functions and loops, and practice writing clean and readable code with exercises 
            for each topic. Students will also learn how to make programs interactive and how to test code safely before
             adding it to a project. It is a fast-paced, thorough introduction to programming with Python 3.6 that will 
             have students writing programs, solving problems,
             and making things that work in no time.

            Cloud native computing uses open-source software stacks to deploy applications as microservices,
             packaging each part into its own container and dynamically orchestrating those containers to optimize 
             resource utilization. In the last 15 years, cloud application delivery has moved from being bound to
              physical servers to running on virtual machines with a full operating system and now to containers
             with Docker, where developers can specify every aspect of deployment.
             Linux containers are poised to take over the world; we will start our course with an 
             introduction of Linux and the command line. For many non-technical people, the command line
              (also referred to as CLI, Terminal, bash, or shell) is a place of mystery. However, you only 
              have to know a handful of basic commands to start feeling comfortable. 
             In this module we will cover the basic commands to get you started.

         <h5>IOT</h5>
         <p id = "iot">
            his course will start by providing a definition of the term.
             We will talk about how various trends have enabled the Internet of Things, and how it changes 
             the way programming is done. We will also discuss 
            some of the ramifications that IoT is having on society today.
            In this module we explore some of the details involved in the design and implementation of IoT devices.
            Unlike traditional computer-based systems, IoT devices are “embedded” within other devices in order to
             provide enhanced functionality without exposing the user to the complexities of a computer. The users
              interact with the device in a natural way, similar to their interactions with any other objects in the
               world. In this module we will discuss the structure
             of embedded systems and describe these interactions with the physical world.

Hardware and Software for IoT
IoT devices are implemented using both hardware and software components. Dedicated hardware components are used to implement the interface with the physical world, and to perform tasks which are more computationally complex. Microcontrollers are used to execute software that interprets inputs and controls the system. This module discusses the roles of both the hardware and software components in the system.
