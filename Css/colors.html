        During his tenure as the Secretary General of the party, 
        Dr. Arif Alvi introduced social media platform in the politics 
        of Pakistan. He was instrumental in holding intra-party election (2012-2013) 
        and enabled millions of party members to digitally participate in the election process. 
        He was elected as member of National Assembly from Karachi in 2013 and 2018 and was instrumental i
        n drafting and the passage of many bills including one on Alternate Dispute Resolution.
         He also chaired the sub-committee of EVM’s, Digital Identification of voters and voting of 
         overseas Pakistanis. The latter has finally come to fruition. Dr. Arif Alvi has keen interest in
          education and health sectors. Provision of basic facilities to the common man and uplifting the country’s 
          image are very close to his heart. He considers people of Pakistan as the most precious asset and, 
          therefore, accords special
         focus to human resource development in the country. He is happily married and has four children.
